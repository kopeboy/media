# Original talk by Lorenzo Cremonesi (journalist) and Zelensky

LC: Well, that's why is important to talk with you sir, because as you know in Italy there are many many pro-Putin, so it's important to hear your message, and as in Europe it is. That's why we are asking can you really fight this war without America and can Europe really help you with Meloni yesterday promising you ..
Z: Miss Meloni is on our side and I'm very thankful to your prime minister Giorgia Meloni. She's on our side and I'm happy with the contract that we signed yesterday but you're right, a lot of pro-Putin are in Italy. First of all, you have to chancel their visas. I'm asking you, really, that's a weapon, that's weapon. If you can't give me air defense (by the way, you have some, I know all the details of what Italy has, but it will not be dangerous for you), you see what's going on when Russians are on the territory of your country, you see the war in Ukraine, that's why I think you have to push them out. But anyway you have different kind of weapon you can help us with, but also it's not that everything depends on Italy, we are speaking about G7 countries, G7 plus, nordic countries plus, EU countries, they have, I think, a lot that they can give, maybe not similar (weapons) like "Patriots" air defense
